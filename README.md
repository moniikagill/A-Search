This is the first part of A* search project.Its a program that reads collection of files that contain information about the roads in Auckland region and builds a displays the information visually by drawing lines for all the road segments. The program lets you zoom in on a smaller region or zoom out. The user can click anywhere on the map to find the name of the road and when user clicks on the search box and types the name of a specific road it highlights the road in red not the map.
